print("ALGORITHM DETAILS:")

print("KEY FEATURES:")

print("✓ Configurable distance tolerance")
print("✓ Handles start-only, end-only, or both misalignments")  
print("✓ Preserves track data quality")

print("✓ Efficient search within reasonable track segments")

print("TOLERANCE RECOMMENDATIONS:")
print("=" * 50)
print("• 0.05km (50m): Precise GPS devices, careful recording")
print("• 0.1km (100m): Standard GPS accuracy, typical use case")
print("• 0.2km (200m): Lower accuracy GPS, urban environments")
